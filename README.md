FEATURES
Many features have been implemented, register, sign in, sing out features have been added as well as authorisation features. CRUD features had been started but the implementation of these had not been finished. Some styling and moustache templates had been used.

Deployment to Heroku was attempted however when trying to link to my heroku profile the connection kept timing out so the deployment was unable to be done.
